# pyFaust

Embedd [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/) DSP programs into Python using CFFI.

I made this in a couple of days.

# FAUSTPy

After checking [Embedded Compiler](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/embedding/),
I noticed FAUSTPy exists, which seems to be pretty much the same thing
but probably much better than mine. You probably want to use that one:

> [FAUSTPy](https://github.com/marcecj/faust_python) is a Python wrapper
for the Faust DSP language. It is implemented using the CFFI and hence
creates the wrapper dynamically at run-time. A updated version of the
project is available on [this fork](https://github.com/hrtlacek/faust_python).
